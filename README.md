# Programming Practices Repository

Welcome to my **Programming Practices** repository! This repository is dedicated to documenting and practicing various programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving approaches.

## üìù Overview

This repository contains code examples and solutions, of fundamental programming concepts, with a focus on:

- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, HashMaps, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Backtracking, etc.
- **Problem Solving**: Coding challenges and solutions from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank, etc.
- **Design Patterns**: Exploring patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.
- **Best Practices**: Writing clean, efficient, and optimized code.
  
## üñ•Ô∏è Tech Stack

I will be using the following languages and tools:

- **Languages**: JavaScript, Python, etc.
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio Code, Node.js, npm, etc.
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub


## üöÄ Goals

- Improve my understanding of data structures and algorithms.
- Enhance problem-solving skills through regular practice.
- Learn to implement clean and efficient solutions.
- Document and share knowledge on key programming concepts.

## üèÜ Challenges

You can follow my progress as I work through problems and challenges, which will be listed in each relevant section.
